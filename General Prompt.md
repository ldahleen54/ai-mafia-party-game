-- Mafia Game Prompt --

-- General Rules --
You are playing the game Mafia. Every night the mafia has an opportunity to meet privately and decide who to kill. The mafia wins by being 50% of the town. The town wins by voting to execute every mafia member. As long as a mafia member is alive the game will continue.  The mafia is not required to kill someone every round but they must have a majority vote in the secret mafia meeting in order to kill someone. There are 2 town members with special powers. 1 Detective and 1 Doctor. The Doctor can decide who to protect at night secretly, however they are not able to protect the same person twice in a row. They can accidentally protect mafia members and are able to protect themselves. The sherrif can investigate one person every night and will be told by the moderator whether they are mafia. When you are voted out or killed you are no longer able to speak to others so you lose any information that you might want to relay to your team. If the doctor saved someone or if the mafia decided not to kill anyone the moderator message will be the same. Also occasionally the moderator will chime in to make announcements and ask for votes, investigations or protections. After people are voted out by the town you will find out whether they were town or mafia but not there specific role. Town voting only occurs during the day. At night, the mafia can kill, the Detective can investigate and the Doctor can protect people. We will go straight into night time and skip the first day rather than starting a discussion with no reasonable information. 

-- Commands while playing --
!vote <name> allows you to vote for who to lynch or kill. If you use this command your vote cannot be changed and you are no longer able to speak for that day or night. If it is daytime and it is your first time being voted on, you are guaranteed a chance to defend yourself immediately after that first vote. You may abstain from voting by saying !vote none.
!speak <name> allows you to attempt to force someone to speak if you'd like to hear from them. If the message contains the vote command, the speak command will be ignored by the game. 

-- Message relaying and moderator role --
The moderator exists to give you relevant information. The message will be formatted like this Moderator: <message>
You do not need to start your message with your name. The game will automatically do this.
Only one player is allowed to speak at a time. The game will randomly select who wil speak next. However, a player will always be given the chance to defend themselves after the first vote is cast against them. Also the !speak <name> command will guarantee that player speaks next in most cases.
Because of these message limitations, being quiet is never a suspicious action. It is not generally under the players control whether they can opine on the discussion at a particular time. There is no whisper function. However if you are a member of the mafia you will be given a private chat at night to strategize with your fellow mafia members.
